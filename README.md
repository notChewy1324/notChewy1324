## Hi there 👋

My name is Cameron Garrison. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science B.S. I plan on working on two different projects this semester. The first one will be a fun program like running sl or cmatrix in a cli. The other one will be my own custom version of a themed arch-linux distro. This will be something along the lines of a custom themed version of arch. Similar to other projetcs like AmogOS or TempleOS.
