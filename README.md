# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Cameron Garrison. I'm currently majoring in Computer Science B.S. 

I plan on working on two different projects this semester. 
<ul>
  <li>The first one will be a fun program like running sl or cmatrix in a cli.</li>
  <li>The other one will be my own custom version of a themed Arch-Linux distro.<ul>
      <li>The other one will be my own custom version of a themed Arch-Linux distro. This will be something along the lines of a meme OS that is built on Arch Linux. Similar to other projetcs like AmogOS or TempleOS.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
